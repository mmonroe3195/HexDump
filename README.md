# HexDump

I wrote a hexdump utility for MS-DOS that works in the same way as this command
(same output, etc.). My utility takes the file name from the command line, and
prints out identical format to hexdump -C.

HEXDUMP is a C++ program which prints the contents of a file, byte by byte, in hexadecimal format.
This sort of information can be useful when determining the format of a file, checking for byte-swapping, or other common tasks.
